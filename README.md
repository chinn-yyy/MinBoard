# MinBoard
Ever wanted to record score for a board game and thought this pen and paper is boring. Well, I introduce you to the MinBoard, the "first" ever mini scoreboard you can take wherever you want. It features two "point" squares and one "time" square that can display how long is left and who is winning.

This design includes 3 buttons, one to add a point to HOME, one to add a point to AWAY, and 1 to reset the SCORE and TIME. Also, there is a push-dial you can adjust the TIME with, spin to change and press to confirm/start.

Here are some photos of my design:
